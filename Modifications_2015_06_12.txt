1. in the first line, I think we should only have the words "riders" "spots" “more” in orange.
2. after the second line, add “click your favorites” (not in orange)
3. “Other motorsport” goes on two lines. Can we keep it on one?
4. Eliminate the whole “a few more" category 
5. let’s change the word “done.” to “finish.” I think people are more accustomed to that. 

Let eliminate the “do your peeps a favor” to the share button. I think i got a little too wordy there haha
